# GP-Nystagmus Eye Tracking & Training System

A Unity-based interactive eye-tracking and training platform designed to aid individuals with oculomotor disorders—such as nystagmus—by improving gaze fixation through gamified visual engagement.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project combines computer vision and interactive gameplay to monitor and improve eye movement control. The user is guided to follow a moving train on-screen while a webcam captures and records eye movement data. This data is later analyzed using deep learning techniques (CNNs) to evaluate progress and diagnose potential disorders.

## 🎮 Game Modes

Two training modules are available:

* 🔗 [Full Train Mode](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_lrU5ZZ7M_gU2Fe3pQ_poHGJD09g1Ga6/view?usp=drive_link)
* 🔗 [Single Train Mode](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uQnZRPEIM_3OgR7_sidVaX8bNVZxBI8W/view?usp=drive_link)

Each mode uses a moving train animation to guide the user’s eye movements. The velocity of the train is adjustable to fit the user's condition or training goal.

## 📊 How It Works

* Users either **upload a video** for analysis or **play the game in real-time**.
* During gameplay, the webcam captures live eye movements.
* The data is stored, processed, and exported for machine learning analysis.

## 📈 Data Collection & Analysis

* All user session data, including time-stamped gaze logs, is exported into Excel format.
* A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is applied to the dataset for diagnostic insight.
