# GP-Nystagmus Eye Tracking & Training System

A Unity-based interactive eye-tracking and training platform designed to aid individuals with oculomotor disorders‚Äîsuch as nystagmus‚Äîby improving gaze fixation through gamified visual engagement.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This project combines computer vision and interactive gameplay to monitor and improve eye movement control. The user is guided to follow a moving train on-screen while a webcam captures and records eye movement data. This data is later analyzed using deep learning techniques (CNNs) to evaluate progress and diagnose potential disorders.

## üéÆ Game Modes

Two training modules are available:

* üîó [Full Train Mode](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_lrU5ZZ7M_gU2Fe3pQ_poHGJD09g1Ga6/view?usp=drive_link)
* üîó [Single Train Mode](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ojR7fiq_VZm6pnLpM2B_Ad2jcESBpvXJ/view?usp=drive_link)

Each mode uses a moving train animation to guide the user‚Äôs eye movements. The velocity of the train is adjustable to fit the user's condition or training goal.

## üìä How It Works

* Users either **upload a video** for analysis or **play the game in real-time**.
* During gameplay, the webcam captures live eye movements.
* The data is stored, processed, and exported for machine learning analysis.

By tracking the movement of the train, the camera captures precise eye movement data, enabling the detection of potential vision issues or disorders such as nystagmus. Additionally, the train's velocity can be adjusted to facilitate tailored rehabilitation programs for specific eye conditions.

You can upload a video for analysis, and we will provide detailed data, or alternatively, you can play the game in real-time. During gameplay, you'll be asked to track the train, and the camera will activate, capturing your eye movements and recording the data in a file for further analysis.
